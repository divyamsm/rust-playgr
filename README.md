## Project 1 - todo list

Through this project, I learnt the use of access identifiers like private and public on structs and methods. I also used the `colorized` crate to add some flair to this project.

The next step in this project will be to persist the todo list in memory.

Steps to run : 
1. Edit main fn in `main.rs` to only have todo() call.
2. From the root of the directory, run `cargo build` and then `cargo run`.
3. Let me know how you feel!
